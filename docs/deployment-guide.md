# Secure Agent Workspace — End-to-End Deployment Guide

## Overview

The Secure Agent Workspace (SAW) deploys a per-user AI agent sandbox running inside a KubeVirt virtual machine on OpenShift. The deployment is fully GitOps-driven via Red Hat Validated Patterns and ArgoCD.

Each sandbox provides an OpenShell gateway with OIDC authentication, governance policy enforcement, and a web-based agent interface — all managed declaratively from Git.

## ArgoCD Applications

All applications are defined in `values-prod.yaml` and deployed by the Validated Patterns framework. ArgoCD syncs them automatically — dependencies are resolved at runtime via init containers and wait loops, not explicit ordering.

| Application | Namespace | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openshift-cnv` | `openshift-cnv` | KubeVirt operator for VM lifecycle |
| `vault` | `vault` | HashiCorp Vault for secret storage |
| `openshift-external-secrets` | `external-secrets` | External Secrets Operator |
| `saw-users` | `openshell-agents` | One namespace and three apps per user, from `overrides/saw-users.yaml` |
| `openshell-keycloak` | `saw-keycloak` | Keycloak OIDC provider + realm |
| `governance-policy` | `openshell-agents` | Policy ConfigMaps (profiles + sandbox policy) |
| `governance-interceptor` | `openshell-agents` | gRPC interceptor deployment; with `global.governance.engine: apf`, the APF inputs and an Argo CD app for the APF chart ([apf.md](apf.md)) |

**Operator Subscriptions:** OpenShift Virtualization, RHBK (Keycloak), External Secrets Operator, RHDH, OpenShift AI.

## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Golden VM Image

The `openshell-gateway-image` BuildConfig creates a Fedora 44 qcow2 image with:

- Docker CE (podman removed), Node.js, Python3, cloud-init, openssh, qemu-guest-agent
- `cloud-user` with sudo access and Docker group membership
- Systemd user service for the OpenShell gateway (`openshell-gateway.service`)
- First-boot setup service (`openshell-gateway-setup.service`) that starts Docker, enables the gateway, and configures mTLS certs

The image is pushed to an internal ImageStream (`openshell-gateway:latest`) and used as a DataSource for cloning VM disks.

Build trigger: `make build-gateway-docker` (Docker variant) or `make build-gateway-podman` (Podman variant), or automatically via ArgoCD.

### Phase 2: Keycloak + OIDC

RHBK operator deploys Keycloak. A `KeycloakRealmImport` creates the `openshell` realm with:

- **Clients:**
  - `openshell-cli` — public client, PKCE with S256, device code flow, 24h token lifetime
  - `openshell-dashboard` — public client, PKCE, redirect URIs registered dynamically per sandbox
- **Users:** developer, admin, alice, bob (test accounts)
- **Roles:** `openshell-user`, `openshell-admin`
- **Token mappers:** realm roles in access tokens, audience mapper so dashboard tokens are accepted by the gateway

### Phase 3: Secrets

ExternalSecret CRs pull from Vault:

| Secret | Vault Path | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openshell-aap-ssh` | `<prefix>/ssh` | SSH private key + public key |
| `openshell-ssh-pubkey` | `<prefix>/ssh` | SSH public key (for cloud-init) |
| `inference` | `<prefix>/inference` | Provider type, model, API key |
| `web-search` | `<prefix>/web-search` | Brave provider and API key |

`<prefix>` is `secret/data/hub` unless a user sets `vaultPrefix`. One shared hub key then serves every workspace. To give one person their own keys, put them in Vault at `secret/data/hub/saw-<user>/...` and set that user's `vaultPrefix` to `secret/data/hub/saw-<user>`. The `saw-users` chart reads the prefix; it does not create Vault entries. See the commented example in `values-secret.yaml.template`.

### Phase 4: Governance Policy

The `governance-policy` chart creates two ConfigMaps from files in the chart:

- `governance-interceptor-policy` — sandbox filesystem/process policy from `policy.yaml`
- `governance-interceptor-profiles` — all `profiles/*.yaml` auto-discovered via Helm glob

The `governance-interceptor` chart deploys the interceptor pod, which mounts both ConfigMaps and serves them over gRPC. See [governance-interceptor.md](governance-interceptor.md) for the full enforcement flow.

### Phase 5: VM Boot + Setup

#### Cloud-init

The VM boots from a clone of the golden image. Cloud-init (rendered by the `cloudinit-sandbox.yaml` template) configures:

- SSH authorized keys for `cloud-user`
- `/etc/openshell/gateway.env` — bind address, port, TLS paths, driver config
- `/etc/openshell/gateway.toml` — OIDC issuer/audience, governance interceptor endpoint and bindings
- Starts `openshell-gateway-setup.service` which bootstraps the gateway user service

#### Setup Job

A Kubernetes Job (`openshell-saw-setup`) runs after the VM boots. It:

1. **Waits for secrets** (init container) — blocks until ESO has created `openshell-aap-ssh` and `inference` secrets
2. **Bootstraps golden image** — creates DataVolume/DataSource if missing, waits for CDI import
3. **Creates cloud-init Secret** — substitutes the SSH public key into the template ConfigMap
4. **Waits for VM** — DataVolume ready, VMI running, SSH reachable, cloud-init complete
5. **Installs binaries** — pulls gateway and supervisor container images via Docker on the VM, extracts binaries, installs openshell CLI via pip
6. **Restarts gateway** with new binaries
7. **Copies scripts** to VM — `run-create.sh`, `setup-nemoclaw.sh`, `configure-vertex-user.sh`, `setup-dashboard.sh`
8. **Fetches OIDC token** from Keycloak for the sandbox owner
9. **Registers dashboard redirect URI** on the Keycloak client via Admin API
10. **Executes `run-create.sh`** on the VM, which:
    - Configures inference provider with API credentials
    - Registers mTLS local gateway (`openshell-local`) and OIDC remote gateway
    - Runs `nemoclaw onboard` in externally-supervised mode
    - Creates sandbox from the configured image
    - Starts the agent web UI (openclaw) inside the sandbox on port 18789
    - Injects SSH public key into the sandbox
    - Starts the dashboard + OAuth2 proxy as Docker containers

## Upgrading from the single-user layout

Before the `saw-users` chart, `values-prod.yaml` defined Alice's SAW directly:
the `saw-alice` namespace and the `openshell-saw`, `saw-bom` and
`pattern-secrets` applications (VM `openshell-saw`). Upgrading an existing
install does not remove them: the pattern's top-level application syncs
without pruning, so the old applications keep running next to the new
`saw-alice*` ones and both manage the same ExternalSecrets and ConfigMap in
`saw-alice`.

Remove the old applications **without cascading**. Every pattern application
carries the `resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io/foreground` finalizer, so
a plain `oc delete application` would also delete the ExternalSecrets and the
`saw-bom-profiles` ConfigMap that the new applications now use.

```bash
ARGO_NS=vp-gitops   # the pattern's Argo CD namespace (global.vpArgoNamespace)
for app in openshell-saw saw-bom pattern-secrets; do
  oc -n "$ARGO_NS" patch application "$app" --type json \
    -p '[{"op":"remove","path":"/metadata/finalizers"}]'
  oc -n "$ARGO_NS" delete application "$app"
done
# The old VM and its disk are no longer managed; delete them.
oc -n saw-alice delete vm openshell-saw
oc -n saw-alice delete datavolume openshell-saw-root --ignore-not-found
```

The `saw-alice*` applications keep the shared objects in place (they self-heal
anything removed). Alice's new VM is `alice` in `saw-alice`: use
`OPENSHELL_SAW_NAME=alice`. Sandboxes and files inside the
old VM are not migrated; the new VM recreates the profile's workspaces and
sandboxes.

## Network Architecture

### Routes

| Route | Target Port | TLS | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<name>-gateway` | 17670 | Passthrough | gRPC gateway (CLI + API) |
| `<name>-dashboard` | 18789 | Passthrough | Openclaw agent web UI |
| `<name>-webui` | 8080 | Edge | OpenShell Dashboard (via oauth2-proxy) |

### Internal Connectivity

| From | To | Protocol | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway (VM) | Governance interceptor (pod) | gRPC over HTTP | Policy enforcement |
| Gateway (VM) | Keycloak (pod) | HTTPS | OIDC token validation |
| Setup Job (pod) | VM | SSH (via virtctl) | Binary install, configuration |
| Dashboard (VM) | Gateway (VM) | gRPC over TLS | Agent operations |

### Authentication Flows

- **CLI:** `openshell gateway login` triggers OIDC device code flow via Keycloak. Token is cached locally and sent as a bearer token on gRPC calls.
- **Dashboard:** OAuth2 proxy handles browser-based OIDC login, proxies authenticated requests to the dashboard backend, which connects to the gateway.
- **Internal (nemoclaw):** mTLS client certificate, registered as `openshell-local` gateway on the VM.
